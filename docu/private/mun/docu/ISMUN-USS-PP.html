        <br>Position Paper of Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY)
        <br>Topic: Addressing the War Powers
    </p>

    <hr>

    <article>
        <p>As Senate Majority Leader, I, Senator Chuck Schumer, representing the people of the great state of New York,
            recognize the separation of powers as a core founding principle that our constitutional fathers intended.
            Article I
            vests the powers to declare war firmly in this Congress, to raise a standing army, and to take command over
            the
            state militia. Our founding fathers intended to establish a system of checks and balances to prevent
            unilateral
            executive action without legislative authorization.</p>

        <p>However, modern conflicts often begin as imperfect engagements <span>4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 37 (1800)</span> that
            do not
            fit the traditional definition of “hostilities” as our founding fathers had in mind. The War Powers
            Resolution (WPR)
            gave Congress a check over presidents who have repeatedly and continuously used the “unitary executive
            theory” to
            expand the Executive Branche’s power including executive privilege <span>542 U.S. 367 (2004)</span>, with
            one simple
            goal: to clarify and restrain the President’s ability to commit forces without congressional approval. This
            goal has
            never been fully achieved; when litigated by members of this House or the people we represent, the case
            often
            becomes moot or is dismissed by federal courts.</p>

        <p>Recently, President Donald John Trump has ordered military actions, such as bombing Iran, without prior
            consultation with Congress, as well as mobilizing the California National Guard in response to the so-called
            invasion. Nesessitating limits of presidential power in military actions without Congressional authorization
            <span>343 U.S. 579 (1952)</span> We all agree that wars are imperfect, but this issue
            extends beyond party lines. When one executive
            reaches too far for power, their successors will look to the precedent that we set today. This Senator moves
            to draw
            parallels and vest powers in the Select Committees of both Houses, requiring consultation and approval in
            appropriate cases to use military force, with checks from members of our Congress.
        </p>

        <p>The WPR was designed to prevent wars from escalating unchecked, yet we lack a formal system to terminate
            conflicts.
            The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) has been broadly applied beyond its original intent
            based on
            the sitting president's discretion. Furthermore, the WPR struggles to address modern warfare tactics, 2019
            Yemen War
            Powers Resolution saw a presidental veto, barring this congress from checking the president's power without
            political checks.
        </p>

        <p>Therefore, I advocate for reforms such as requiring explicit congressional approval for all military actions
            except
            immediate self-defense, establishing joint congressional committees to authorize operations, and enforcing
            the
            60-day limit on deployments more rigorously. These proposals aim to restore constitutional balance and
            prevent
            executive overreach. </p>

        <p>In conclusion, my position is one of measured leadership: to ensure that the War Powers Resolution remains a
            vital
            tool for congressional oversight, safeguarding our constitutional balance, and promoting responsible U.S.
            foreign
            policy. I stand committed to working with all Senators—across party lines—to uphold these principles and
            protect the
            American people from unnecessary military entanglements while preserving our nation’s security interests.
            Bipartisan
            cooperation is essential to address these challenges effectively and to reaffirm Congress’s rightful role in
            decisions of war and peace. </p>
