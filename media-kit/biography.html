Woody recognises climate change as one of the most pressing challenges of our time. This led to a challenge to the status quo by taking part in a. Selective research internship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under Dr. Lam Hon-Ming and Dr. Yung Wai-Shing Vincent. His work focused on GM Soybeans at the State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, aiming to develop solutions that address the challenges and difficulties of rural communities facing the immediate effects of extreme climate. 

His passion for sustainability led him to the creation of his capstone project, "Dual functional catalyst for Green Hydrogen Production". His project aimed at making the battery of the future — Hydrogen, not only more economically viable, but also more efficient. His innovation and dedication have led him and his team to Top Awards at the world's largest science fair — Regeneron ISEF 2025. Woody's recognition at such a prestigious award reflects not only his scientific rigour but also his impact-driven visionary approach to tackling global energy issues.

*Youth Empowerment*
Woody's commitment to empowering youth is exemplified not just by taking on leadership posts at school but also extending to his community. Woody has not only organised a TEDx event, but also taken a lead in the program curation, carefully selecting the TOP voices of young innovations, to inspire local secondary students to take small action that compounds into success. 

*Scientia per Vim*
Growing up, Woody's core values have been led by the belief that "knowledge can transform the world," Woody's commitment to youth empowerment, MUN and being a student presenter at the Biannual Gifted Education Confrence, has not only allowed him to hone his communication skills and negation, but more importantly preparing him to advocate for impact change.
